# server-client-chat
This is a one simple Server-Client chat system in which we can create one server and connect that server for chatting purpose!!!
This is Socket Programming using Python!!!
These is real time chat system in which we can chat to our friends, just using IP address of server!!!

Just clone my Repo and you will get two python files:
1) Server.py
2) client.py

run command: 
  python3 Server.py in one terminal
  python3 client.py in another terminal
  python3 client.py in one more terminal

  and then send a massage from one client to another and see the message is sent at real time!!!

  server just connect these Nodes i.e.two clients.
